1. For starters, I just spent an hour trying to set this directory up as a 
   Git repository, pain in the ***

2. I decided to go through the functions sequentially, so next I worked on 
   overloading the insertion and extraction operators. This took forever.
   Repeatedly ran into an error saying the types 'istream' and 'ostream'
   were not a member of namespace std. I updated my makefile to compile in
   c++ 11, I added various libraries and tried using namespace std on my code
   (which I hate). I checked some c++ references and finally realized that I
   failed to specify the function as a 'friend' of the class. Not that I'm an
   expert, but I think the debugging messages i received were misleading.

3. The comparison operators were all overloaded without any trouble,
   but every instance of 'git push' requires me to enter a username and 
   password and it's really annoying. I spent like an hour generating and
   storing an RSA key in my ssh agent, and then I still go through this???
